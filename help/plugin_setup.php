<b>
Welcome to the Twilio Control tools plugin Help page</b>

<p>You will need to create an account at Twilio

<p>The account credentials that you have will then be used to configure this plugin

<p>Additionally, there are a few built in commands that allow the control number(s) to do that are not configurable
<li>Sending an SMS of 'enable' will enable the plugin to accept SMS messages. The system will notify ALL control numbers that this action has taken place
<li>Sending an SMS of 'disable' will disable the plugin to accept SMS messages. The system will notify ALL control numbers that this action has taken place
<li>Sending an SMS of 'mode NAMES' will change the system to output the PRE TEXT FOR NAMES mode and the text sent 
<li>Sending an SMS of 'mode FREE' will chane the system to output free text to the matrix
<p>
You may sign up with a Trial account at first with Twilio, however; you will need to verify at least one phone number with caller-id in order to receive the responses
back from the Twilio FPP Plugin. If you do not do this, you will not be able to reliably know if the system is working properly. Once you have a full account,
you will not have this requirement. All numbers sending in an SMS will be able to interact with the system.
<p>
We will include proper configuration setup instructions for Twilio as time permits. Please consult the forum on Falconchristmas.com for up to date information
